# Nurgling2 (package: `nurgling`) – Source Documentation (Starter Wiki)

This documentation set is a *source-driven starter* intended to help you (as a developer and power user) build a full wiki for the Nurgling2 custom Haven & Hearth client.

It focuses on:
- How the **base client** (`haven.*`) is extended by **Nurgling** (`nurgling.*`).
- Where core gameplay interactions live (UI, map, inventory, gobs, menus).
- How the automation/bot framework works (Actions, bots menu, scenarios).
- Practical patterns for adding **new UI windows and controls** and wiring them into bots.

The most immediately useful pages for automation work are:
- `automation/bots-and-actions.md`
- `automation/forager-bot.md`
- `scenarios/scenarios.md`
- `areas/areas-system.md`
- `navigation/chunk-nav.md`
