# Legacy routes system

This client also contains an older “routes” system (distinct from ChunkNav).

- Documentation exists in the source tree at `src/nurgling/docs/routes/routes.md`.
- It is used to connect **areas** via route points/links so some bots/scenarios can traverse between them.

Important note:
- The Forager bot does **not** use this routes system. It uses its own `ForagerPath`.
